# **PEWLETT HACKARD ANALYSIS**

## **OVERVIEW**

The purpose of the analysis challenge was to analyze Pewlett Hackard's wave of retiring employees per title and to identify which employees are eligible for the mentorship program. We were able to use our database software and the SQL query language to filter the parameters we required to analyze the data.

### **Results**

After reviewing our filtered data, we found a few major points:

* 72,458 employees who are currently employed would be ready for retirement in the near future.

* This also indicates 72,458 positions will require new employees as the "silver tsunami" begins to make its impact on Pewlett Hackard

* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program

* This also indicates that there are not nearly enough employees eligible for the mentorship program compared to the number of retirees. 

* There is a total of 240,124 employees currently working at Pewlett Hackard and 72,458 employees in the "silver tsunami", Pewlett Hackard is expecting to lose approximately 30% of their workforce. Over 50,000 of those employees being "Senior Engineers" or "Senior Staff". 

### **Summary**

I have added additonal queries at the end of the "Employment_Database_challenge.sql" file which can acquire the total the number of engineers by specific title. By doing this, we are able to see how many engineers would be required specifically for each level of engineering. We may also rewrite the code to apply to the other staff positions as well. 

Pewlett Hackard can now see where they would need to start hiring the most as well as which positions need to be filled in the near future. In this case, our query tells us Pewlett Hackard would require the most amount of new employees to fill in their "Senior Engineeers" position. 

### **Mentorship Eligibility**

From our data, we can see that 72,458 positions are being vacated across the board for Pewlett Hackard to prepare for the upcoming wave of the "silver tsunami". To prepare, one of the elements Pewlett Hackard would like us to check is how many employees are eligible for their mentorship program.  

Unfortunately, there aren't nearly enough employees to one on one mentor the number of positions required as the wave of current retiring employees begins to retire. As shown from the data in the chart below, the number eligible mentors is only at 1,549 at the moment. For "Senior Engineers" alone, there would be approximately 56,000 employees to mentor after the wave of senior staff has retired.

Pewlett Hackard will have to do a substantial amount of hiring and training up ahead.
